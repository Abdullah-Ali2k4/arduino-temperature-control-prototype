# Arduino Temperature Control Prototype

This project demonstrates temperature control using an Arduino Nano and a potentiometer to simulate temperature changes. When the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, a buzzer sounds and a fan activates to cool down the system.

## Components Used

- Arduino Nano
- Potentiometer
- Buzzer
- Fan
- Breadboard
- Serial Analyzer (for data visualization)

## Mathematical Concepts

### Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)

The potentiometer outputs an analog voltage proportional to the simulated temperature. This voltage is converted to a digital value (`adcVal`) using the Arduino's built-in ADC, which ranges from 0 to 1023 (10-bit resolution).

### Temperature Calculation

The analog voltage (`milliVolt`) is converted to temperature in Celsius (`temperature_C`) and Fahrenheit (`temperature_F`):
\[ \text{temperature\_C} = \frac{\text{milliVolt}}{10} \]
\[ \text{temperature\_F} = \text{temperature\_C} \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \]

### Temperature Threshold and Control

The project sets a temperature threshold of 70Â°C. When the simulated temperature exceeds this threshold, the buzzer sounds and the fan activates to cool the system.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the potentiometer, buzzer, and fan to the Arduino Nano as per the circuit diagram.

2. **Upload Code**:
   - Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Monitor Temperature**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view temperature readings and control actions.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the integration of Arduino programming, mathematical calculations for temperature conversion, and practical application of temperature control using basic electronic components. It serves as a prototype for further development in temperature monitoring and regulation systems.
